    "##### Why Dask?\n",
    "> Most of the BigData analytics will be using Pandas, NumPy for analyzing big data. All the mentioned packages support a wide variety of computations. But when the dataset doesn’t fit in the memory these packages will not scale. Here comes dask. When the dataset doesn’t “fit in memory” dask extends the dataset to “fit into disk”. Dask allows us to easily scale out to clusters or scale down to single machine based on the size of the dataset. "
