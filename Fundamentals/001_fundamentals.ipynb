    "Machine learning enables a machine to automatically learn from data, improve performance from experiences, and predict things without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "With the help of sample historical data, which is known as training data, machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model that helps in making predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.<br> Machine learning brings computer science and statistics together for creating predictive models. Machine learning constructs or uses the algorithms that learn from historical data.<br>  \n",
